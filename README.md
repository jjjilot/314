# CS314
From syllabus:

Introduction to computer organization and instruction-set architecture - digital logic design, binary arithmetic, design of central processing unit and memory, machine-level programming.  In addition to machine-level programming, this course will provide an introduction to the C programming language in the context of bitwise operations, memory management, pointers to memory, and translation between C and the x86-64 instruction set architecture.

Upon successful completion of the course, students will have acquired the following essential skills:
  - be able to use bitwise operations to efficiently solve problems in C.
  - be able to write iterative and recursive algorithms in C and assembly language.
  - be able to debug C code using gdb, debug assembly code using an interactive assembler/debugger.
  - be able to optimize C code with respect to instruction counts, unpredictable branches, and memory-access patterns.
  - be able to implement a basic direct-mapped caching solution.

Taught by Dr. Eric D. Wills at University of Oregon.
